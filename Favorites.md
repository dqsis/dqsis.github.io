# Work tools
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/): My favorite *note-taking* app, which operates on Markdown files. 
	- I use Obsidian to take notes, create to-do lists, write down my thoughts, save pieces of knowledge and much more. 
	- I have purchased the [Obsidian Sync](https://obsidian.md/sync) version so that I can access my files from anywhere, and from any platform.   
	- Note: This website is written using Obsidian. 
	- My daily notes template (which uses ) can be found here.
