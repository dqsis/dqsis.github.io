# Work tools
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/): My favorite *note-taking* app, which operates on Markdown files. 
	- I use Obsidian to take notes, create to-do lists, write down my thoughts, save pieces of knowledge and much more. 
	- I have purchased the [Obsidian Sync](https://obsidian.md/sync) version so that I can access my files from anywhere, and from any platform.   
		- Note 1: This website is written using Obsidian. 
		- Note 2: My daily notes template can be found [here](https://github.com/dqsis/dqsis.github.io/blob/main/files/daily%20notes%20template.md).
