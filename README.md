## About me
### Studies 
I studied [Mechanical Engineering](http://www.mech.ntua.gr/en) at the National Technical University of Athens. At the age of 23, my interest for mathematics and [programming](http://web.stanford.edu/class/me200c/tutorial_77/) -and my curiosity to live abroad- brought me to Graz, Austria, where I did research on [angioplasty and stents](http://fmysql.tu-graz.ac.at/~karl/verlagspdf/buch_kiousis.pdf).
### Work
In 2008 I came to the west coast of Sweden and worked on designing [rocket](http://www.arianespace.com/vehicle/ariane-5/) and [jet](http://www.pratt-whitney.com/PurePowerPW1000G_Engine) engines to withstand thermo-mechanical fatigue.

In 2013 I moved to Gothenburg, where, for 3.5 years, I worked as a Consultant Manager in the field of Virtual Product Development. During that time I had the possibility to experience several highly technological branches ranging from Automotive to Packaging.  

Directly afterwards (in January 2017), I joined Mentice where, for 5 years, me and my team of Project Managers lead the development of [Virtual Reality simulation software](http://www.mentice.com/), within the fields of endovascular intervention and minimally invasive surgery.

Between August 2022 and January 2024 I worked as an Innovation Manager at the [Region of Västra Götaland](https://www.vgregion.se/ov/innovationsplattformen/) and at [Sahlgrenska University Hospital](https://www.sahlgrenska.se/en/). My primary focus was the collaboration between the public healthcare sector and the private industry sector. I also served as Innovation coach for a series of projects driven by clinical personnel within the region.

Since February 2024, I have been serving as Product Owner at [Glooko](https://glooko.com/), leading the Cloud Integrations team. I am thrilled to be working on a cutting-edge digital health platform that unifies data from many of the leading diabetes devices, delivering thus insights that improve personal and clinical decision support.

### Personal information and interests
I have [a beautiful wife](https://twitter.com/kalliopierripi) and two incredible daughters.

I enjoy a variety of free-time activities, ranging from electric guitar to 3D printing. However, I spend most of my free time practicing endurance sports. I started swimming when I was six, and have not stopped since then. But I am also a cyclist and a runner. In 2014 I rode Mont Ventoux, in 2015 Passo dello Stelvio, and in 2022 Alpe d’Huez. In 2021 I ran for the first time the [Athens Marathon](https://www.athensauthenticmarathon.gr/site/index.php/en/) in 4hrs33min, which I did again (together with my wife this time) in 2023.

I try to read [2 to 3 books per month](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/58873133-dimitrios-kiousis?shelf=read). My favorite possession is my [Honda Monkey](https://photos.app.goo.gl/evcdJG2P9QxK2cpy6) which I bought in March 2022.
